# Pomodoro Timer

A simple and elegant Pomodoro Timer application to help you stay focused and productive using the Pomodoro Technique.

> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) called "pomodoros," followed by short breaks. This approach is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and help maintain focus over longer periods.
>
> The method consists of the following basic steps:
>
> 1. Choose a task to work on
> 2. Set the timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)
> 3. Work on the task until the timer rings
> 4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
> 5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)
>
> This structured approach to work and breaks helps combat mental fatigue, reduce distractions, and maintain consistent productivity throughout the day.
